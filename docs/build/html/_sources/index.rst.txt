Deploying and Managing Windows with code!
=========================================

Why are you here?
-----------------

Tired of limitations of the Windows GUI? Want to work more efficiently? After years of saying 'I'm not a developer,' this documentation is my guide on how to get started with Git, Chocolatey, and Puppet.

This is a work in progress. As I began to find a documentation solution that worked with my new workflow, I suddenly realized I was documenting my code with code. Creating this documentation is part of my learning process.
