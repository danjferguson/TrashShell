Overview
--------

SCCM was never the solution people wanted it to be many times because of the complexity and costs, especially in smaller environments. Other third party tools have various learning curves or costs depending on how quickly it allows IT professionals to get started deploying packages. Chocolatey by itself is an excellent command line tool for deploying software, even for home users and especially for those helping less experienced users install software. The last thing you want to do when you're visiting family over the holidays is to spend it updating their software they haven't updated since the last time you touched their computer. Now, with a few short scripts you can not only get a computer setup quickly, but you can provide reliable updates on systems remotely.

Installation
------------

Chocolatey's documentation is some of the best I've run through. As I find notes about deploying Chocolatey in a new environment for the first time, there will be additional examples here to help you tailor it to your needs.

Package Deployment
------------------

Once the install has been completed, it is a matter of running the new PowerShell command.
