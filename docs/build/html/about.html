<h3>Graphical User Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#graphical-user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most Windows administrators have lived in a GUI interface most of their careers. Microsoft has made considerable improvments in providing a streamlined GUI interface to manage multiple servers. The Server Management tools refined in Server 2012r2 really help to begin to bridge the gap between RDPing into every server and using remote management tools. Unfortunately, without version control and change management, it lacks the precision that Linux system administrators have enjoyed using Puppet.</p>

<h3>Command Line Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#command-line-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chances are you have spent a lot of time being frustrated by CLI commands, syntax, and connection methods. Is this a serial connection? SSH? Telnet? Do I have to ‘enable’ the CLI to use admin commands? When do I need to use a login mechanism? These are all questions people unfamiliar with CLI will ask themselves.</p>
<p>After using CLI on systems as old as Hyperlink terminals and BBS to PowerShell Core 6, the first thing to remember is that you will never remember all their syntax options. Transitioning to multiple vendors and generations can lead to frustration. The most important thing to remmeber as you adapt DevOps into your workflow is that you don’t actually need to know that much CLI to manage your systems with code. Most of the time, you’re going to be using code someone else has used before and adapting it to your purposes. Actually running the commands from the terminal interface can be very different from managing your environment with code. You will probably do a lot of back and forth between running live code and running completed projects. You will have disasters, and you will probably spend a lot of time reseasrching a problem that you caused because you didn’t understand what you were doing. You will eventually get better, learn how to recover faster, and hopefully build new solutions with your DevOps skills.</p>

<h3>Microsoft’s Change in Direction<a class="headerlink" href="#microsoft-s-change-in-direction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Open source has won. Vendors continue to have propriety code that does something special, but for managing systems and creating better solutions for business, IT is an open source, collaborative environment. Microsoft has invested heavily in GitHub not only by uploading their own code, but also buying the entire platform because the focus is now on verson control and community involvement. MS software updates are coming at breakneck speeds, and they are able to achieve that by using the DevOps work flows in this documentiation. If you look at many of the MS GitHub repos, they are using Puppet and Chocolatey to manage their environments. Linux and Windows are becoming closer than ever, and the winners are system administrators, as we have all new tools to build out and scale impresive environments now, instead of being stuck in the era of finding obscure driver packages for RAID controllers and figuring out how to load them on a floppy disk, Windows now enjoys the same level of automation and standardization that Linux admins have enjoyed for years.</p>

<h3>Market Demands More Productivity<a class="headerlink" href="#market-demands-more-productivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>IT staff everywhere have been cut. In almost 18 years, never have I heard any IT department say they are fully staffed and enjoy being able to tackle new projects because people have the time to invest in adding new functions. Things change at such speed that many environments try to bottle their configurations in hopes that nothing ever changes. Thanks to security concerns, compliance demands, and less money to achieve amazing results, IT is now needing to save wherever possible. Automation and managing your infrastructe as code is the solution to these complex problems. It won’t be solved overnight, and there will likely be many hurdles along the way, but emrbacing the standardization will help minimize the frustration long term.</p>
