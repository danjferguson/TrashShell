Failure is Fine

You're probably at a section and hit the braindead button. If you just explored the ToC and found this page, go learn something before you read the disaster stories below. These are the chronicals of my reflections on transitioning to managing everything with code. Even as I develop this documentation, it seems overwhelming sometimes think about how much the direction of my work has changed. For the first time in my career, stepping into the DevOps world made me feel like I had no idea what I was doing. My hope is that if you think it is too much for you to handle right now, go to this page, grab your favorite beverage, and allow me share my misadventures in the hopes you can find some humor or solace in them.

The Text Editor
---------------

After a random day looking for an update to the free Visual Studio tool, I happened across Visual Studio Code. This was familiar from previous free versions of Visual Studio I had used, but it became clear that this was an aggressive move by Microsoft to get into the hands of all the open source developers out there. After checking out the Marketplace Extensions, the terminal integration with PowerShell, and the ability to install it on all my systems, I was hooked.

My job was changing, and I was moving on to another opportunity where I would be working with two Linux system adminsitrators most of the time. It took some adjusting, but after working with various Windows teams, I found myself with the liberty to improve or destroy everything around me. After having worked with Linux and Unix teams in the past, I was fully ready to be mocked for my VS Code text editor in comparison to Vim. Like all children growing up should do, I dabbled in Linux for a time on my AMD K5 in college, installing Mandrake, Suse, and any other distro that my university's T1 could provide me. After suffering through numerous poorly deployed Linux systems in the past, my focus had been on Microsoft reliability. Did I just say reliability? Yes, yes I did.

The year was 2012, and Microsoft was going quickly from 2012 to 2012r2 with significant improvements. Not only that but PowerShell was really taking off as scripting language for system administrators. Yes, I found myself easily able to setup a CentOS or Debian VM within a Server 2012r2 hypervisor, but taking into account updates, learning bash, and all the quirks of whatever random distrobution was being used for the snowflake application it was built to run, I found myself running away from Linux as a small business system adminsitrator. I knew that the interet ran on Linux, but I wasn't operating in that space. It was a waste of time and energy from my perspective. Little did I know that my industry was changing to where it will soon become required knowledge for system administrators.

Very quietly, Microsoft was opening the doors to open source. Unbenownst to me, they were putting code on GitHub. They were shifting to a high tempo devops environment, and like many, I was more focused on the Office 365 migration to really notice that Microsoft was developing some really powerful tools to scale out the Windows ecosystem to match the scale of the competition.

Now back in 2018, my new environment provided me the avenue to use BitBucket/Stash to store all my PowerShell scripts. After spending some time trying to understand all the concepts my Linux collegues were used to rattling off easily, I spent some time creating and recreating my work environment. Because I did not fully understand all that version control could offer me, I stored all my local scripts in a OneDrive location that I accessed from mutiple machines. Because I mainly worked on my MacBook Pro, I never really ran into an issue. As soon as I had to switch to my Windows box to test scripts, I found out that Git does not like to be syncrhonized by something else. Thankfully, I was able to call for help and unwind things before I had to start over from scratch, but even then, I had already created future problems when I was trying to correct my earliest mistakes.

How many Windows system administrators use capital letter? I will admit that it took me far longer than it should have to go through and elminate all my capital letters. Now, I avoid them like the plague, and I recommend that anyone else getting into this does as well. I'm just too lazy to have to remember which times I capitalized and which times I did not. I don't have time to deal with a GUI anymore, why do I want to worry about one other trivial problem I created myself?

Spending more and more time learning Git and PowerShell, the question of which
