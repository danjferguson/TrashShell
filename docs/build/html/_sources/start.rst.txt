Starting with the correct tools is critical if you are just getting started. Back when writing batch startup scripts was the most complicated thing I did, notepad.exe was sufficient. As scripts and datasets became more complicated, Notepad++ was a solution that I relied on for years. Then, I stumbled upon Sublime, which was a big improvement overall and began my journey into a DevOps world. In 2018, with all the file types that need to be used, and on a variety of platforms, you need good software to run your scripts. Many people continue to use PowerShell ISE or other third-party options.

Start with the tool Microsoft is using to make all this happen. VS Code can be deployed manually or through Chocolatey quickly on Window, but can still be used on MacOS or Linux if you have a need to use any platform. VS Code has built in Git integration, provides multiple shell access methods, while still giving you some user friendly options as you find yourself moving deeper into the DevOps waters.
